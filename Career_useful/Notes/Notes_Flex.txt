    flex-flow -> combination of wrap and direction

    justify-content - center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, space-evenly, right;
    

    align-items - center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch 
    
    align-content - The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
