CSS Positions:  

    4 css  prop 

        top 
        bottom
        left 
        right 


        The above 4 prop can only be applied to elements which are positioned 

            position: static / relative / absolute / fixed / sticky 

        
        position: static;
            By default every dom element has its position as static 
                1. It doesnt change its position from its default 
                2. It doesnt consider the top, left , right or bottom prop 

        position: relative

            1. Any element with position relative, is capable of moving to any new position (it is capabale of considering left, right, bottom or top prop )

            2. While am moving to a new position, it doesnt loose its own default position (under x y axis)


By default every satic elements will be rendering on xy axis 

2. By default every non static elements will move from xy axis to z axis

3. only the elements which are under z axis can be moved to any req position


Positions absolute:
    1. While moving to a new position, it doesnt hold its own original position in xy axis 
    2. While  moving to a new position, it always moves relative to its parent position
    3. While depending on the parent position, it only depends on the parent who is non static parent.
