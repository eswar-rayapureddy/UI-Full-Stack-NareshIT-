Control structures: Logical ability will increase by having clear understanding of control structures

3 types:
Conditional - If-else, nested if-else,else if
Looping  - for,do-while,for each, for of, for in
Case  - Switch case

Conditional control structre:
Anything you want to perform based on condition
When we wrote instructions in the program it may kip or execute based on the given condition

if(condition)-- condition can be one or more
{
------
}
if (true){
console.log("----");
}
if (false)
{
console.log("-----");
}
if(avg>=40){
console.log("if got executed")
}
if(avg<=40){
console.log("average less than 40")
}

Based on codnition either to execute set of instructions or skip is done by conditional control structures.

DEBUGGING

Go to Inspect - Click on Source tab.
Source tab :It contains list of all source code which is needed for the current web page.

Now go to the line number where you want to put break point. Click on the line number and number will be highlighted which means break pint is set at that particular position.
Similarly where ever you want to put breakpoint please click that line number and breakpoint will be set.

Play button: used to toggle between break points
Next button: moves  to next commdn in execution
Watch- Click on + and add variables for which we like to see the values during execution
mouse over to see the value
if(condition)
{
---}
else
{----}

The if condition is executed when the condition becomes true and when it is false the else part get executed. Instead of giving multiple if conditions 
if we give else we are saving time to check multiple if .
For example: If I want to check for Male and Female - instead of checking - if(male),if(female) -- we can use - if(male){}else{}; Instead of tow if getting executed we are doing this with one if using else condition.
NESTED IF CONDITON CONTROL STRUCTURE:
if(condition){
------
	if(condition){
		------
		     }
	}
Putting if in another if 
if(avg>=40)
{
	console.log("student passed");
	console.log("Student got first class");
}
else
{
	console.log("Student is failed")
}
The above if can be rewritten using nested if as
if(avg>=40)
{
	console.log("student passed");
	if(avg>=60)
		{ console.log("Student got first class")
		}
}
else
{
	console.log("Student is failed")
}


ELSE IF CONDITIONAL STRUCTURE
I don't want to execute ELSE directly and in the ELSE also I want to check the condition.

Example:
if (avg >= 40) 
{
     console.log("Student got passed");

      if (avg >= 90) 
	{
          console.log("you got distinction")
       } else if (avg >= 60) {
          console.log("student got First class");
       } else {
          console.log("you gor second class")
       }
} else
 {
    console.log("student got failed");
}


assignment:
Write a program to work with employee details like empname,gender,location,basic salaray,total sal=pf+hra+basic salary
get total tax
  gnder is male 

        totalsal >= 100000

            taxpercent is 15% on total sal 

        totaalsal >= 50000
            taxpercent  10%

        totaalsal >= 250000
            taxpercent is 5% 

        else    
            taxpercent 0 

 gnder is female 

        totalsal >= 100000

            taxpercent is 10%

        totaalsal >= 50000
            taxpercent  5%

        else    
            taxpercent 0
