    Error - 

        Compile Time error 


        Runtime errors 


        compiler 
            1. check for all syntactical errors 
            2. convert to system understandable language

            var a = 90
            var a 90

            if (true) {
                b = 100
            }

            if true 
                b = 100
        Interpreter/execution:

                Error - exception
                Runtime errors / runtime exceptions

Exception handling  
    try 
    catch 
    finally 
    throw 
    throws 

    ------------------

    try block -> add all the set of statement in which there is a chance of getting runtime error, under try block

        1. every try block should have either catch or finally block 

        try {
            /// 
            ///
        } catch() {
            /// code to handle error been raised in try block
        } finally {
            /// code which for sure need to get executed, irrelevant of whether there is an exception been raised or not..
        }
