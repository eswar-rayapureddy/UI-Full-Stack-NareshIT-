-- 1. Create Tables
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- 2. Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 10),
(2, 'Bob', 20),
(3, 'Charlie', NULL),
(4, 'Diana', 30);

INSERT INTO Departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES
(10, 'HR'),
(20, 'Engineering'),
(40, 'Marketing');

-- 3. INNER JOIN
SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, d.dept_name AS Department
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 4. LEFT JOIN
SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, d.dept_name AS Department
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 5. RIGHT JOIN
SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, d.dept_name AS Department
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 6. FULL OUTER JOIN (Use UNION if your DB doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN)
SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, d.dept_name AS Department
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id

UNION

SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, d.dept_name AS Department
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
